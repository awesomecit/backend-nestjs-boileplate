       expect(await loadBalancer.getHealthyInstances()).toHaveLength(3);
       expect(await loadBalancer.checkTrafficDistribution()).toBe('even');
     });
   });
   ```

   ```

2. **Integration Testing**

   ```bash
   # End-to-end testing
   npm run test:e2e:deployment
   npm run test:e2e:monitoring
   npm run test:e2e:scaling
   ```

3. **Monitoring Testing**
